Thank you for purchasing the Low-Poly Speedboats asset!

Please use the Prefabbed objects included in the package.

This speedboat is designed to act as a simple boat for use in low poly or mobile games. It does not feature realistic / movable speedometers or navigation -- The flat-faced low poly look, and the smooth-faced low poly look.
I plan on updating this package every two weeks with more skins and aircraft. Please feel free to suggest ones you may like!
The stick, tiller, propellor, motor, and wheel are all individial on each of these boats and can be manipulated for animation or kept as-is.
Colliders have been attached to appropriate objects.
